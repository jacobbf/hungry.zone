A first post! Welcome to the Hungry Zone. The idea for a site like this popped up in the spring of 2019. Instead of making it I played several hundred hours of Monster Hunter World. Now it’s the spring of 2020, we’re quaratining and social distancing. And while I still intend to spend several hundred hours of Animal Crossing and Dragon Quest XI S: Definitive Edition I also have a sense of ugency about documenting and sharing things that I didn't a year ago. Hopefully people will feel similarly and we can share some food through the site. 

## Instructions 
I usually just season everything directly on the baking tray but if you want to be thorough you can toss the broccoli in a bowl with the flour, seasonings and oil to get a more even crispiness.

1. If your broccoli is particularly fresh or damp you may want to let it sit out for a little a head of time, or if you're short on time just pat it down with a paper towel to dry it - this helps it crisp up in the oven.
2. Before you start chopping preheat the oven to 450 degrees. Hotter is better on this one so if you have a trash oven (like I do) you may want to over shoot just a bit.
3. Chop the broccoli into small pieces, maybe about a quarter inch wide, don't discard the stalks, they actually cook up really well like this (and you should be saving them for soup anyway). If you're using frozen broccoli open the bag I guess.
4. Spread a generous (but reasonable) splash of vegtable oil on your baking tray and add the broccoli.
5. Sprinkle kosher salt, cumin, salt, garlic power and flower.
