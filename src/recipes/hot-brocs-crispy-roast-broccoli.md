A first post! Welcome to the Hungry Zone. The idea to do a cookbook site like this first showed up in the spring of 2019 but instead of making it I played several hundred hours of Monster Hunter World. Now it’s the spring of 2020, we’re quaratining and social distancing. And while I still intend to spend several hundred hours of Animal Crossing and Dragon Quest XI S: Definitive Edition I also have a sense of ugency about documenting and sharing things that I didn't a year ago. Hopefully people who are feeling that too find there way here and we can share some food through the site.

These Hot Brocs though - this is my lazy person's version of the fried broccoli I've been missing from a place near my house that closed a little while ago. Spice them, oil them and if all goes well, you end up with a big batch of hot crispy brocs with none of the grease splatter. It also happens to be a good recipe for using some of the two million pounds of frozen broccoli my sisters bought at the begining of the quarantine. I've also been thinking you could probably batter these brocs properly and really make them fluffy, but I haven't given it a go yet - let me know if you try it!

## Ingredients
- Any amount of broccoli (fresh or frozen)
- Flour
- Kosher salt
- Cumin
- Garlic powder

## Instructions 
I usually just season everything directly on the baking tray but if you want to be thorough you can toss the broccoli in a bowl with the flour, seasonings and oil to get a more even crispiness.

1. If your broccoli is particularly fresh or damp you may want to let it sit out for a little a head of time, or if you're short on time just pat it down with a paper towel to dry it - this helps it crisp up in the oven.
2. Before you start chopping preheat the oven to 450 degrees. Hotter is better on this one so if you have a trash oven (like I do) you may want to over shoot just a bit.
3. Chop the broccoli into small pieces, maybe about a quarter inch wide, don't discard the stalks, they actually cook up really well like this (and you should be saving them for soup anyway). If you're using frozen broccoli open the bag I guess.
4. Spread a generous (but reasonable) splash of vegtable oil on your baking tray and add the broccoli.
5. Sprinkle kosher salt, cumin, garlic power and flour. Then add just a drizzle of additional oil to top.
6. Toss the tray into the oven and remove when the broccoli crispy and browned on the edges, it should take about 30 min, but you'll probably want to keep an eye on them
